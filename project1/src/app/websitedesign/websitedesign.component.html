<h1>Website Design</h1>

<h3>History from 1988 to 2001</h3>
<p>Although web design has a fairly recent history. It can be linked to other areas such as graphic design, 
    user experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen from a technological standpoint. It has 
    become a large part of people's everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated 
    graphics, different styles of typography, background, videos and music.</p>

<h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>Progressive enhancement is a strategy in web design that puts emphasis on web content first, allowing 
    everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, whilst users with additional 
    browser features or faster Internet access receive the enhanced version instead.
    In practice, this means serving content through HTML and applying styling and animation through CSS to 
    the technically possible extent, then applying further enhancements through JavaScript. Pages' text is 
    loaded immediately through the HTML source code rather than having to wait for JavaScript to initiate and
     load the content subsequently, which allows content to be readable with minimum loading time and 
     bandwidth, and through text-based browsers, and maximizes backwards compatibility.
    <br>
    As an example, MediaWiki-based sites including Wikipedia use progressive enhancement, as they remain 
    usable while JavaScript and even CSS is deactivated, as pages' content is included in the page's HTML 
    source code, whereas counter-example Everipedia relies on JavaScript to load pages' content subsequently;
     a blank page appears with JavaScript deactivated.</p>
    
<h3>Page Layout</h3>
<p>Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the page layout. For example, a designer
     may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing
      the layout. Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. 
      The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most 
      popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular 
      monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of aesthetics on larger screens.</p>

<h3>Static Websites</h3>
<p>A static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is requested,
     the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the website. It is 
     usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, similar to a dynamic
      website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. These automatically created static 
      sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as Jekyll and Adobe Muse.
    The benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed to serve
    static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration and had less 
    chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost server hardware.
     These advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and
      virtual servers offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.</p>
<h3>Dynamic Websites</h3>
<p>Dynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate webpages. They 
    typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a 
    relational database to query a catalogue or to summarise numeric information, others may use a document 
    database such as MongoDB or NoSQL to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.
    In the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or wireframed using static pages. The skillset 
    needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static pages, involving server-side and 
    database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus 
    almost always a team effort.</p>

                    <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and 
                        maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; 
                        user interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary 
                        software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many 
                        individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although 
                        some designers will cover them all. The term "web design" is normally used to describe 
                        the design process relating to the front-end design of a website including 
                        writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web 
                        development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date 
                        with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

                    <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet 
                        (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from 
                        developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic
                         businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web 
                         development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content 
                         development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network 
                         security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among Web professionals, "Web 
                         development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing 
                         markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make 
                         content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>

                    <h6 style="text-align:center;">SEO</h6>
                    <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of 
                        website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid 
                        traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.
                         Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, 
                         video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search 
                         engines. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the 
                         computer-programmed algorithms that dictate search engine behavior, what people search for,
                          the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines 
                          are preferred by their targeted audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive 
                          more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results 
                          page (SERP).</p>
